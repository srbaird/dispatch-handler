/**
 * A default implementation of the DispatchHandler interface specifying
 * the handle return type as Object.
 * 
 * Given an Object o of indeterminate type and an implementation of Visitor
 * then the appropriate handle or dispatch method will be dynamically selected
 * at run time
 * 	
 *  DefaultDispatchHandler dispatcher = new DefaultDispatchHandler();
 * 
 * 	Visitor v;
 * 	Object o = "a String";
 * 
 * 	dispatcher.dispatch(v,o);
 * 
 * In the above example a method with signature 
 * 
 * 	void dispatch(String s) 
 * 
 * will be invoked if one exists. If one does not exist then the most
 * appropriate method will be selected where the lower bound is the default
 * method in the Visitor interface.
